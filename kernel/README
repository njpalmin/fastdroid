VNC Keyboard driver for Android
===============================

The VNC keyboard driver is an emulated keyboard for the VNC server
to send keyboard events to Android framework.

It is useful if the keypad driver doesn't support a full keyboard. 
Without the driver, VNC can only send the keys available on the keypad. 
This driver allows VNC server to use the full range of keys for the
VNC client.

INSTALLATION
===================
To install the driver to an Android platform, one can add the source file
vnckbd.c to 

    kernel/drivers/input/keyboard
    
and modify Kconfig and Makefile there according to the instructions in
the local files:

	Kconfig
	Makefile

Configure and build the kernel as usual:

	$ make menuconfig
	
	Go to menu: 
		Device Drivers ->
			Input device support ->
				 Keyboards ->
	Select:
		VNC keyboard driver
		VNC keyboard input device

This should enable the following options in .config	
	CONFIG_KEYBOARD_VNC
	CONFIG_KEYBOARD_VNC_SELF

After configuration, build and load the new kernel. There should be
a new input device /dev/input/event<N>. It can be checked by the command:

	$ cat /proc/bus/input/devices
	
I: Bus=0019 Vendor=0001 Product=0001 Version=0100
N: Name="VNC keyboard"
P: Phys=vnckbd/input0
S: Sysfs=/devices/platform/vnc-keyboard/input/input0
U: Uniq=
H: Handlers=kbd event0 cpufreq
